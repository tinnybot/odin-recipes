        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 free-range eggs</li>
            <li>225g/8oz caster sugar, plus a little extra for dusting the finished cake</li>
            <li>225g/8oz self-raising flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>225g/8oz baking spread at room temperature, plus a little extra to grease the tins</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>To Serve</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Good-quality strawberry or raspberry jam</li>
            <li>Whipped double cream (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease and line two 20cm/8in sandwich tins.</li>
            <li>Break the eggs into a large mixing bowl, then add the sugar, flour, baking powder and butter. Mix together until well combined with an electric hand mixer (you can also use a wooden spoon), but be careful not to over mix. Put a damp cloth under your bowl when you’re mixing to stop it moving around. The finished mixture should fall off a spoon easily.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture evenly between the tins: this doesn’t need to be exact, but you can weigh the filled tins if you want to check. Use a spatula to remove all of the mixture from the bowl and gently smooth the surface of the cakes.</li>
            <li>Bake the cakes on the middle shelf of the oven for 25 minutes. Check them after 20 minutes. The cakes are done when they’re golden-brown and coming away from the edge of the tins. Press them gently to check – they should be springy to the touch.</li>
            <li>Set aside to cool in their tins for 5 minutes. Run a palette or rounded butter knife around the inside edge of the tins and carefully turn the cakes out onto a cooling rack.</li>
            <li>To assemble the cake, place one cake upside down onto a plate and spread it with plenty of jam. If you want to, you can spread over whipped cream too.</li>
            <li>Top with the second cake, top-side up. Sprinkle over the caster sugar.</li>
        </ol>
